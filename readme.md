**#Mystery Word game**

**##Motivation**

I chose this game because of my love for word puzzles and I thought
this would be a game I could enjoy. I like that the game is simple and basic word game and you can guess what
the word is, it's simple but addicting.

The words are positioned using Reg Exp and allow the users' selected letter to be revealed one by one
the word without giving away the whole word at the same time.

##ScreenShots

The user can click the the buttons on the screen to slowly reveal the word, if it's wrong
the letter appends to an empty side div.

**#Tech/Framework used**

Javascript ES6 | Node.js | CSS3 | HTML5


I did use a yaml eslint to clean up the code and make sure my code was presentable. I was also
taught how to order the JS page and make it look readable and more function for loading with the 
html.

The hardest part of the game was the solution for revealing the word, it took some time but
with research and a lot of googling it was possible to accomplish.

For the future I do plan to add sounds to the guesses when it is wrong and when it is right
so the user can feel more engaged and have the game be more interactive for the player. Also 
there are some features that need fixing because the game isn't 100% complete. But I am happy
with the result so far especially the button appending to another div also that I was able to 
get new divs to be randomly created with the selection of the new word in the Phrase function.
